# C-language-learning-codes-and-tinkering.
Codes I made through learning in lessons and activities and self-learning through YouTube and the help of AI.

Tools I use for self learning: Youtube.com (programming Tutorials), Claude.ai, https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/, VsCodium.
Operating System: Windows 11 & Arch Linux

Learning Roadmap: 
+Understand basic concepts of C Language
+debugging
+understanding printf, if and else statements, using switch, int, and char.

Need to improve
-understand fgets, arrays, loops, understand and use if and else statements efficiently, clean and good, use switch for other purposes, understanding operators, using fptr understanding it clearly so I won't rely on AI

Need to Do:
-actually code
-actually code in linux so it won't rot on my other drive
-learn different languages like JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and Python.
